# Tom's Task List — Workshop Template

Training template for an AI-Assisted Coding workshop. The project is a **Chrome Extension Task List app** that grows across 5 tasks, each adding a new layer while practising AI-assisted coding with GitHub Copilot and Claude.

---

## Prerequisites

Install **before** the workshop:

1. **VS Code** — https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. **GitHub Copilot** — subscription or trial required
   (Ctrl+Shift+X → search "GitHub Copilot" → install both Copilot + Copilot Chat)
3. **Google Chrome** — latest version
4. **OpenRouter API key** — needed for Task 5 only:
   - Create a free account at https://openrouter.ai/
   - Generate an API key at https://openrouter.ai/keys
   - Free tier gives access to several models
5. **GitHub account** — for forking the repo

## Running the Project

No `npm install`, no bundler, no Live Server needed. The app runs as a Chrome Extension.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone <url>`
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project root folder
5. The Tom's Task List icon appears in the Chrome toolbar — click it to open the popup
6. Done

**After every code change:** click the refresh icon (↺) on the extension tile in `chrome://extensions`, then reopen the popup.

**Debugging:** right-click the popup → **Inspect** → Console tab.

## Project Structure

| File / Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | Chrome Extension configuration (Manifest V3) |
| `popup.html` | Popup UI — structure + all CSS (Tom's theme) |
| `popup.js` | Application logic — all function stubs for Tasks 1–5 |
| `options.html` | Settings page — OpenRouter API key input |
| `options.js` | Settings logic — stubs for Task 5 |
| `icons/` | Extension icons (16, 48, 128 px) |
| `TASKS.md` | Full description of all 5 workshop tasks (trainer reference) |
| `CONVENTIONS.md` | Code conventions + working-with-AI tips |
| `PROMPTS.md` | Prompt library (trainer reference) |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | AI context file for GitHub Copilot |

> **Icons note:** Generate `icons/icon16.png`, `icons/icon48.png`, and `icons/icon128.png` before loading the extension. Use [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) or any icon tool. A reference SVG is provided in `icons/icon.svg`.

## Workshop Plan

| Task | What you build |
|---|---|
| Task 1 | Add tasks & persist with `chrome.storage.local` |
| Task 2 | Mark done & delete with event delegation |
| Task 3 | Filter bar (All / Active / Done) & task counter |
| Task 4 | Due dates, urgency badges & sorting |
| Task 5 | AI priority suggestions via OpenRouter API |

---

## Branches and Checkpoints

Each task branch is a starting point — it contains completed code from all previous tasks. If you get stuck or run out of time, simply switch to the next branch and continue from there.

| Branch | State |
|---|---|
| `task-1` | Starting point for Task 1 (template with stubs) |
| `task-2` | Task 1 complete — starting point for Task 2 |
| `task-3` | Tasks 1–2 complete — starting point for Task 3 |
| `task-4` | Tasks 1–3 complete — starting point for Task 4 |
| `task-5` | Tasks 1–4 complete — starting point for Task 5 |
| `final` | All 5 tasks complete |

> **Can't finish a task?** No problem — the next branch has it done for you. Just `git stash`, checkout the next branch, and keep going.

### Git Workflow

```bash
git checkout task-1        # start here

git checkout -b my-task-1  # your working branch
# … code with Copilot …
git add . && git commit -m "feat: add and display todos with chrome.storage"

# Stuck? Check the next branch for a working reference:
git stash                  # save your work
git checkout task-2        # has Task 1 already done
```

---

## Technical Requirements

- Browser: **Google Chrome** (required — extension APIs are Chrome-specific)
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot
- Internet connection (GitHub Copilot, OpenRouter API for Task 5)
